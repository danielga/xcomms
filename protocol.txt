xcomms protocol (common)
{
	uint8[7] = {'X', 'C', 'O', 'M', 'M', 'S', 'Z'}
	-- Z being the protocol revision in a uint8
	-- protocol revisions should be backward compatible unless otherwise told
	uint8 type -- player(s) joined/added, left/removed, position update, etc
	
	xcomms protocol revision dependant data
	xcomms packet -- content depends on 'type'
}

xcomms protocol example (rev01)
{
	xcomms packet (player(s) joined/added)
	{
		uint8 count -- number of players on this packet
		uint8 reset -- boolean telling us to reset the current list
		player -- repeated 'count' times
		{
			string name -- nul terminated
			uint64 steamid64
		}
	}

	xcomms packet (player(s) update)
	{
		-- player is only updated if there is something to update
		-- e.g. flags is not 0
		player (repeated x times)
		{
			uint64 steamid64 -- identifies the player
			uint8 flags -- if name, health, pos or angle are on this player's update, in bit 1, 2, etc, respectively
			string name -- (optional, nul terminated) player name updated
			uint8 health -- (optional) 0 represents death or negative health, 255 represents health above 254
			int16 x -- (optional) player's x component of position vector (rounded float)
			int16 y -- (optional) player's y component of position vector (rounded float)
			int16 z -- (optional) player's z component of position vector (rounded float)
			int8 p -- (optional) player's p component of view angle (-180/180 skewed into -127/127 range)
			int8 yw -- (optional) player's y component of view angle (-180/180 skewed into -127/127 range)
			int8 r -- (optional) player's r component of view angle (-180/180 skewed into -127/127 range)
		}
